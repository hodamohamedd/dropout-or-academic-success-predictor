# Student Dropout Prediction

## Problem Description

Educational institutions face significant challenges with student dropout rates. When students drop out, it represents:
- Lost tuition revenue for the institution
- Inefficient use of educational resources
- Negative impact on institutional performance metrics
- Potentially negative outcomes for the students themselves

This project develops a machine learning model that predicts which students are at risk of dropping out based on information available at enrollment time. By identifying at-risk students early, institutions can implement targeted intervention strategies to improve retention rates.

## Business Impact

Early identification of at-risk students allows institutions to:
1. **Reduce Revenue Loss**: Prevent tuition revenue loss from dropouts
2. **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Direct support resources to students who need them most
3. **Improve Institutional Metrics**: Enhance graduation rates and institutional rankings
4. **Better Student Outcomes**: Help more students successfully complete their education

For a detailed business impact analysis with ROI calculations, see [Business Impact Analysis](docs/business_impact.md).

## Dataset

This project uses the ["Dropout or Academic Success" dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankanhore545/dropout-or-academic-success), which contains information about students' academic paths, demographics, and socio-economic factors. The dataset allows for a three-category classification task:
- **Dropout**: Students who leave without completing their degree
- **Enrolled**: Students who are still pursuing their degree
- **Graduate**: Students who successfully complete their degree

## GCP Deployment

For detailed instructions on deploying to Google Cloud Platform, see [GCP Deployment Guide](docs/gcp_deployment.md).

Quick deployment steps:

1. Set up GCP project and enable APIs:
```bash
   gcloud auth login
```
# Edit gcp_setup.sh
```bash
cd scripts
./gcp_setup.sh
```
# Or manualys setup step by step
